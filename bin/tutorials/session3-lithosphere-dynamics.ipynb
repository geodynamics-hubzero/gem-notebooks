    "## Lithosphere Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational lithospheric dynamics is a vast topic, and this notebook serves as an introduction, not a comprehensive review. To learn more, please review the additional examples in ASPECT (cookbooks, benchmarks), the ASPECT source code, and the extensive literature on the subject, including other lithospheric dynamic codes. Non-linear lithospheric dynamics is difficult so it is a good idea to properly set your expectations for the amount of time it takes to conduct a novel study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will go over modeling the relationships between crustal deformation, lithospheric deformation, and mantle convection. Remember, these processes occur over time and spatial scares which can vary dramatically:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Define what physical processes to examine\n",
    "2. Capture the physics through equations\n",
    "3. Choose a numerical approximation to solve the equations\n",
    "4. Design, write, and validate software (or validate existing code)\n",

    "### Capture Physics Through Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the governing equations describe incompressible viscous flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stokes Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\nabla * u = 0 $\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $\\nabla * \\sigma' -\\nabla P +\\rho g = 0$ \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In case you are unfamiliar with these equations, let's take a moment to understand what they mean.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the first of the Stokes equations, $\\nabla *$ denotes divergence, while $u$ denotes the vector field of the fluid's velocity. The divergence of a vector field at a certain point is a measure of the change of the field's density at that point. A divergence of zero means that the field's density is constant at that point. The first equation states that for any point within the vector field of the fluid's velocity, the divergence remains the same. In other words, despite the fact that the fluid is flowing, the fluid remains at a constant density throughout. This is the same thing as saying that the fluid is incompressible, which makes sense because these equations describe incompressible viscous flow. This first equation is the mass conservation equation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the second of the stokes equations, $\\sigma'$ denotes the stress tensor, $\\nabla$ denotes the gradient, (note: $\\nabla$ differs from $\\nabla*$ as they are both differential operators, but different kinds) $P$ denotes pressure, $\\rho$ denotes density, and $g$ denotes gravity. The gradient of a vector field is a function describing the direction and rate in which the vector field increases the most for each point in the field. When a point within the vector field is taken as input into the gradient operator, the return value is a vector whose direction signifies the direction at that point in the flow field in which the value of the field increases the most. The magnitude of this vector signifies the rate of greatest increase at that point. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The second equation represents a balance of Pressure, Viscous, and Gravity forces. It is also the applciation of the second law of motion to an incompressible fluid, ignoring effect of inertia on the fluids acceleration (it is reasonable to ignore inertia because of the viscocity and time scale of mantle convection). \n",
    "\n",
    "    The term $-\\nabla P +\\rho g$ represents the pressure and gravity forces, while the term $\\nabla * \\sigma' $ represents the viscoelastic force.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Conservation of Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\rho c (\\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta t}+u*\\nabla T) = \\nabla * K\\nabla T +H $\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This equation describes how energy is conserved in this model of incompressible viscous flow. Here, $c$ denotes heat capacity at constant temperature, $K$ denotes thermal conductivity, $\\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta t}$ denotes the derivative of temprature T with respect to time t, and H denotes the heat radiated by the fluid. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The equation states that the only increase in temperature is due to internal heat production ($+H$). In compressible fluids, temperature and density are related and so more terms are needed on the right hand side of the equation to account for temperature changes caused by compression. However, since we are modelling incompressible viscous flow, density is constant and so the above equation is accurate. It describes the evolution of $T$ temperature as a scalar field (meaning, the temperature of the fluid across it's entire area/volume) over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rheology\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rheology includes nonlinear viscous flow like diffusion, dislocation and composite creep, viscoelasticity, and plasticity. Each of these relationships are described by nonlinear systems of equations which are not trivial to solve. For complex simulations, you may need to heavily limit the number of nonlinear iterations per time step in order to run a model in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Formulate a Hypothesis to Test\n",
    "\n",
    "When investigating lithosphere dynamics, a few areas invite study through geodynamic modeling, such as continental extension, subduction, and thrust sheets. In these cases rheology, rates of deformation, and the initial lithospheric structure (among other attributes) control the resulting patterns of deformation. When designing a hypothesis to test, it is important to think about which of these controls can and should be modelled. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial: Viscoelastic Bending Beam\n",
    "\n",
    "Viscoelasticity is especially important to describing lithosphere dynamics in regions experiencing flexure. An example of viscoelastic behavior might be an oceanic plate undergoing subduction, or a plate straining under the weight of material erupted by volcanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASPECT includes viscoelastic and viscoplastic material models and an elastic rheology model for simulating viscoelastic deformation. A number of benchmark .prm files make use of these material and rheology models, and are found in the /benchmarks directory within an ASPECT installation. These benchmarks serve as tools to verify that ASPECT solves various problems accurately. Alone, they are not necesarily intended as accurate models of geophysics processes. Rather, the benchmarks represent simplified scenarios in which to test ASPECT's adherance to physical laws. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be using the viscoelastic_bending_beam.prm file. This benchmark consists of a dense viscoelastic beam within a low density viscous fluid. Both materials are subjected to the force of gravity. Over the course of the simulation, gravity causes the dense beam to flex downward within the viscous fluid. The beam doesn't sink because one of its sides is \"connected\" to the side of the 2D box by designating that side as a \"no-slip\" surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to verify the elasticity of the beam, we will stop applying the force of gravity partway through the simulation. If everything is working correctly, we should see the beam rebound to it's original position after the force of gravity is eliminated from the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few steps to follow in order to cancel gravity partway through the simulation and allow the beam to rebound. \n",

    "\n",
    "Divergent plate boundary forces give rise to magmatism as well as varied deformation mechanisms including brittle, viscous, and elastic deformation. These are processes controlling lithosphere dynamics in continental rift zones, which can be investigated using ASPECT models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The continental extension tutorial uses a 2D box model, which represents a vertical cross section through an extension zone. Divergent forces work on the the model, applying tension outward on the box horizontally. At the same time, upwelling mantle material applies an upward force on the bottom of the box. Continental crust makes up the top 30km of the box, while the mantle forms the bottom 70km. Their respective densities are 2700$kg/m^3$ and 3300$kg/m^3$ which correspond to the real world values. Temperature increases from 500°C at the crust/mantle boundary to 1200°C at the bottom boundary of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top portion of the model is a [free surface](https://aspect-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/methods/freesurface/index.html), where the mesh can be deformed by forces from within the model.

This is meant to represent the surface of the lithosphere, above which there is insufficient material to prevent the flow of rocks. \n",
    "\n",
