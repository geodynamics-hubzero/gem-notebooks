These forces generate compressive stress at convergent boundaries, tensional stress at divergent boundaries and shear stress at transform boundaries.\n","2. **Local dynamics:** small-scale stresses arising due to lateral variations in buoyancy.\n","3. **Isostatic forces:** e.g., local stress changes due to vertical isostatic adjustments of the lithosphere.\n","4. **Thermal stresses:** contraction and expansion of rocks due to temperature variations in the lithosphere, e.g., due to radiogenic heat generation, cooling of oceanic lithosphere, etc.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["An estimation of the stress state in the lithosphere is therefore important for a better understanding of the plate driving forces, and the forces governing earthquake generation.
