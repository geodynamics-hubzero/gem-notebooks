## Making GEM-notebooks better

GEM-notebooks is a community project, aimed at creating educational modules in geodynamics 
using open-source software. We encourage all contributions that can help make these 
module more accessible and clearer to our users. Some examples include any contributions
of an problem/example to better convey a geodynamic process or a physical process that is 
not yet covered in these modules.
